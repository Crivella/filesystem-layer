This roles directory contains a submodule that points to the repository of the Galaxy Ansible role for installing/configuring CVMFS, which can be found at:
https://github.com/galaxyproject/ansible-cvmfs

We renamed the directory to "cvmfs", so we can use "cvmfs" as the name of this role in our Ansible playbooks.
